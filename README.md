To start both the react and express server, run the following command:

`npm run dev`

Using the user interface, the user can register, login, and create a profile.
With the installation of a an API interrogator such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), a developer can create users, profiles, groups, posts, likes, comments, and chat with other users. Future development of this project aims to bring all of the back-end features to the front-end.
